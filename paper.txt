\section{Related Work}

Inverse kinematics (IK) is a fundamental problem in robotics, and various approaches have been proposed to solve it effectively, particularly in the presence of singularities and joint constraints. The Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse method has been widely used due to its simplicity and ability to provide a least-squares solution for IK problems \cite{Whitney_1969}. However, this approach does not handle singularities explicitly, leading to potentially unstable joint movements near singular configurations \cite{Nakamura_2022}.

To mitigate singularity issues, Damped Least Squares (DLS) was introduced, which adds a damping factor to the least-squares formulation to improve numerical stability and reduce the sensitivity to singularities \cite{Wampler_2021}. DLS has proven effective, but selecting an appropriate damping factor is challenging and often problem-specific \cite{Buss_2020}. The Selectively Damped Least Squares (SDLS) method further improves upon DLS by selectively applying damping only in problematic directions \cite{Chiaverini_2019}. While SDLS enhances stability, it may introduce inefficiencies and does not explicitly handle multiple task prioritization.

Quadratic Programming (QP) approaches have also gained popularity in recent years for solving IK problems with additional constraints. By formulating the IK problem as a QP, constraints such as joint limits and obstacle avoidance can be naturally integrated into the solution \cite{Hogan_2020}. These methods allow for joint-specific weighting and prioritization of multiple tasks, making them suitable for complex robotic applications \cite{Escande_2021}. However, traditional QP formulations may suffer from computational inefficiencies, especially when dealing with high-dimensional robotic systems.

More recent work has focused on adaptive weighting schemes to improve the flexibility of QP-based IK solvers. Adaptive methods dynamically adjust joint priorities based on task requirements and joint configurations, allowing the robotic arm to better handle complex scenarios \cite{Stulp_2021}. Our approach builds upon these advancements by integrating adaptive weighting with DLS to enhance stability, improve task prioritization, and reduce computational overhead.

In summary, our work extends the state of the art by combining DLS with adaptive QP weighting, addressing the limitations of traditional methods such as pseudoinverse, DLS, and SDLS. This integration provides a more robust and flexible solution for robotic inverse kinematics, suitable for a wide range of manipulation tasks.
