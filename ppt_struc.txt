### 1: Introduction

  - Robotic arms face significant challenges in achieving precise, reliable movements, particularly when dealing with singularities and joint limits.
  - Traditional IK methods struggle with performance in complex configurations, often requiring manual tuning.
  - This research focuses on developing an adaptive weighting scheme integrated with Damped Least Squares (DLS) to address these challenges.
  - The adaptive method dynamically adjusts joint weights based on their proximity to limits and central positions, improving flexibility, joint limit avoidance, and singularity handling.


### 2: Research Problem

  - Singularities and joint limit violations impact stability and accuracy.
  - Traditional methods require manual tuning and often perform poorly in complex configurations.


### 3: Motivation

  - Provide robust IK solutions across different scenarios.
  - Address challenges like joint limit avoidance and better performance in difficult configurations.
  - More intelligent, adaptive solvers that can adjust to the robot’s current state.
  - Previous experiments showed the weighted method’s success, justifying improvements through adaptive weighting.
  - Potential for more natural movements and reduced need for manual tuning.

Improvement: Selective damping methods why we use it here? and any variant approaches of it?

### 4: Contribution

  - Development of an adaptive weighting scheme for IK, dynamically adjusting weights based on the robot’s configuration.
  - Enhanced performance in challenging scenarios, especially near joint limits and in complex orientations.
  - Comprehensive analysis comparing adaptive weighting against fixed weighting, DLS, and selective damping methods.
  - Improvements in joint limit avoidance, singularity handling, and computational efficiency.


### 5: Methodology


#### Adaptive Weighting Scheme Development:
  - Formulation of adaptive weights:
    - Base weights for each joint.
    - Limit factor: Increases weight as joint approaches limits.
    - Center factor: Increases weight as joint moves away from the center position.
  - Model:  
    w_i(q) = w_{base,i} \cdot f_{limit}(q_i) \cdot f_{center}(q_i)
    

#### Inverse Kinematics Solver Implementation:
  - Integrated adaptive weighting into the Damped Least Squares (DLS) framework.
  - Objective function:  
    \min_{\Delta q} \sum_{i=1}^n w_i(q) (\Delta q_i)^2
  - Includes constraint handling for matching the end-effector pose.

#### Metrics:
  - Position error, Orientation error, Pose error, Joint space error
 
  - linear error, angular error, computation time, iteration
  
  - robot motion position, velocity, acceleration
  
Improvement: any different between Position error, Orientation error and linear error, angular error?


#### Scenarios:
  - Nominal Reach: Standard reach within comfortable workspace.
  - Extended Reach: Tasks near workspace boundaries.
  - Overhead Reach: Tasks requiring overhead motions.
  - Low Reach: Near the base or floor-level tasks.
  - Complex Orientation: Challenging end-effector orientations.



### 6: Experiment for Demonstration
  - Comparison between fixed and adaptive weighting methods in five scenarios.
  - Results show improved position, orientation, and joint space accuracy.
  - Computational efficiency analysis indicates a trade-off between enhanced performance and increased complexity.


Improvement: 

The metrics setting is mass, they should be uniform that Position error, Orientation error, joint space error, pose error
                                                         Computation time, iteration, success
                                                         
The scenarios setting according to different environment

We try to setup three main experiments 我要改造这个部分，首先把metrics统一起来，然后分别整合三个实验部分，第一没有设置scenarios的方法之间的比较；第二设置了5个scenarios的比较；第三multi-tasks handling的分析；第四simulation比较

还有一点我们整个实验要demonstrate的东西不明确



## Reference

Improvement: References need to be added

Chat: which part should I cite with the reference, can you point it out?
